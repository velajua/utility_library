# Utility Library

This repository contains a collection of useful functions in Python, including web scraping, API integrations and day-to-day code snippets.

These functions can be easily integrated into your projects to save time and effort. The repository is organized into various sections, each containing a description of the functions included, as well as the requirements for running each of the functions.

Note that some of the functions are dependent on others.

## Modules

The following modules are included in this repository:

- [`ip_utils`](ip_utils/README.md): A module for working with IP addresses
- [`redis_utils`](redis_utils/README.md): A module for working with the Redis database

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, sets, lists, and sorted sets, and provides a rich set of commands to operate on these data structures.

Redis is often used as a fast, reliable, and scalable caching solution, due to its ability to store data entirely in memory, which makes it much faster than disk-based databases. It also provides features such as data persistence and replication for improved reliability and availability.

Some of the key features of Redis include:

High performance: Redis is designed to be extremely fast, with the ability to perform millions of operations per second.
Data structures: Redis supports a variety of data structures, including strings, hashes, sets, lists, and sorted sets, which can be used to store and manipulate data in a flexible way.
Persistence: Redis provides various mechanisms to persist data to disk, including snapshotting and append-only files.
Replication: Redis supports master-slave replication, allowing multiple Redis instances to be used for improved availability and scalability.
Lua scripting: Redis allows Lua scripts to be executed directly on the server, which can be used to implement complex data manipulations or transactions.
Redis can be accessed through a number of client libraries in various programming languages, including Python, Java, Ruby, and Node.js. The Redis commands can be sent to Redis server through the client libraries and responses can be received and parsed back.

Overall, Redis is a versatile and powerful tool for managing and storing data, and can be used in a wide range of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
