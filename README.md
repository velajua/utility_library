# Utility Library

This repository contains a collection of useful functions in Python, including web scraping, API integrations and day-to-day code snippets.

These functions can be easily integrated into your projects to save time and effort. The repository is organized into various sections, each containing a description of the functions included, as well as the requirements for running each of the functions.

Note that some of the functions are dependent on others.

## Modules

The following modules are included in this repository:

- [`ip_utils`](ip_utils/README.md): A module for working with IP addresses
- [`redis_utils`](redis_utils/README.md): A module for working with the Redis database

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, sets, lists, and sorted sets, and provides a rich set of commands to operate on these data structures.

Redis is often used as a fast, reliable, and scalable caching solution, due to its ability to store data entirely in memory, which makes it much faster than disk-based databases. It also provides features such as data persistence and replication for improved reliability and availability.

Some of the key features of Redis include:

High performance: Redis is designed to be extremely fast, with the ability to perform millions of operations per second.
Data structures: Redis supports a variety of data structures, including strings, hashes, sets, lists, and sorted sets, which can be used to store and manipulate data in a flexible way.
Persistence: Redis provides various mechanisms to persist data to disk, including snapshotting and append-only files.
Replication: Redis supports master-slave replication, allowing multiple Redis instances to be used for improved availability and scalability.
Lua scripting: Redis allows Lua scripts to be executed directly on the server, which can be used to implement complex data manipulations or transactions.
Redis can be accessed through a number of client libraries in various programming languages, including Python, Java, Ruby, and Node.js. The Redis commands can be sent to Redis server through the client libraries and responses can be received and parsed back.

Overall, Redis is a versatile and powerful tool for managing and storing data, and can be used in a wide range of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

- [`selenium_utils`](selenium_utils/README.md): A module for automating web browsers with Selenium

Selenium is a popular open-source framework for automating web browsers. It provides a set of tools and APIs to automate web browsers and perform various tasks, such as testing web applications, web scraping, and web automation.

Selenium is primarily used to automate testing of web applications. It allows developers and testers to write automated test scripts in various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C#, and Ruby. These test scripts can then be executed on different web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer, to test the functionality of the web application under different conditions.

Selenium provides a set of APIs to interact with web elements, such as buttons, links, text fields, and dropdowns. It can simulate user actions such as clicking, typing, and scrolling. Selenium also provides the ability to capture screenshots, manage cookies and sessions, and handle pop-ups and alerts.

Selenium can be used to perform web scraping, where it can extract data from websites by navigating to web pages, extracting data from HTML elements, and saving the data in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON.

Overall, Selenium is a powerful tool for web automation and testing, and is widely used in the software development industry. It provides a flexible and reliable way to automate repetitive tasks and test the functionality of web applications.
